                    exam! This hard-earned feat has opened up for you the possibility of a seat in the BTech or
                    other 4-5 year UG programme in one of the IITs, India's premier and world-renowned engineering
                    institutions.If you are offered a seat in any IIT, it is the best stepping-stone to a rewarding
                    career!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The IITs recognise the sterling role that women engineers can play in the development of Indian
                    society and the importance of a good gender ratio in the classroom.The IIT system has adopted a
                    number of measures to make our UG programmes more attractive to female students.We strongly
                    encourage you to fill in a large number of choices for branches and IITs to maximise your chance
                    of being allotted an IIT seat.

                    women faculty/students/alumni at several IITs who are ready to answer your queries.If you wish
